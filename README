Prometheus Beta 0.1

After all these years in the darkness of campusnet, Prometheus is here to give humanity
the fire of downloading. Ok maybe it's not that great, and hopefully I will not be equally
punished for it.

Prometheus will however try to bring a new way of downloading to campusnet. The ultimate
goal is to create a new download experience in cooperation with campussearch. This CLI
client is only a small bit of what prometheus will become. A GUI client will also come
plus a daemon that aims to automate downloading as much as possible, together with
cool features on the campussearch website.

I choose to create the CLI client first because that was my biggest problem with campusnet
at the moment. You can download things simply with v-direct, but if you don't have access
to a windowmanager (downloading over ssh for instance), downloading from campusnet can be
pretty painful.

Since this is a beta version i would like to ask everyone to use it and give me feedback
about it. If you have a great idea how to download a file, browse a share or you did something
weird (or not) and the whole thing broke down just send me a message. While it is platform independent
software it has not been tested on many systems, so it is possible that it doesn't work on your system.

===Installation
You _must_ have JDK 1.5 or higher installed.

Then it's pretty easy, just unzip the file somewhere and edit the configfile.
In the configfile the only thing you have to set right now is "downloadDirectory" for instance:
downloadDirectory=/home/test/Downloads or downloadDirectory=c:\downloads\

===Bugs && feedback
